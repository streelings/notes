# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which needs "slip").

* First bullet
* Second bullet

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://google.com

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

* I put references at the bottom
