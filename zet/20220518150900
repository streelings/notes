# (First real zet!) Learn coding that synergizes with close-friends skills

It's been a few years since I wanted to learn coding. Every resource tells you to have a project in mind before you start coding because it will make it more engaging, etc. When you don't understand what coding is it's easy to not have an answer to this prompt. 
Today, it came to me. Learn coding projects that synergize with close-friends skills. My closest friends from school are now in accounting/finance/supply chain/marketing and similar stuff. I shit you not, every single one of them is doing well in their career - these are incredibly smart, motivated, friendly people. 
I should learn coding in some way that would service the closest 4-5 of these friends whom I'll be tight with for the rest of my life. Could lead to a small business someday.
